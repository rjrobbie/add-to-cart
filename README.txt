## Concept

To build a progressive web app that using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that hooks up to a realtime Firebase database to enable CRUD operations.

## Things I would do next time

Build custom modals that inform the user if the list is empty or an item is already in the list.
Add a function that stops duplicate entries being made to the list.
Enable users to use this functionality instead of just me.
